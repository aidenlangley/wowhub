        A favourite whakatauki of ours that embodies our ideals perfectly. A
        strong individual empowers us all. Working with te tangata (individual)
        to empower them in their recovery.

      <Paragraph justify>
        Within each individual there's a whanau, a hap큰, and an iwi. We take a
        holistic approach to treatment, focusing on M훮ori models of care like Te
        Whare Tapa Wh훮 which encompasses taking care of the hinengaroa (mind),
        wairua (spirit), tinana (body) and wh훮nau (family.)
